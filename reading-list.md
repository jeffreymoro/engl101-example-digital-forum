boyd, danah. "Facebook's Privacy Trainwreck: Exposure, Invasion, and Social Convergence." *Convergence*, vol. 14, no. 1, 2008, pp. 13–20. 

- boyd's article focuses on the 2006 introduction of the "News Feed" feature to Facebook, which prompted considerable outcry from its users given how it programmatically exposed information about use that users otherwise assumed was private. In doing so, boyd builds a case that technology can use the imprimatur of "accessible information" to "rupture people's sense of public and private" (14). boyd's article is informed by her past research on teenagers' use of social media, and as such is a vital resource for those who teach young people, particularly those thinking about how various media composition practices and platforms can expose different kinds of behaviors our students might otherwise want to keep private. 

Ellis, Erik and Dave Underwood. "Completely Out of My Domain: An Institutional Narrative of Multimedia Collaboration." *Kairos*, vol. 20, no. 1, fall 2015, <http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.1/coverweb/ellis-underwood/index.html>. 

- Ellis and Underwood's multimedia essay uses a case study at the University of Colorado, Boulder to interrogate the role that institutional configurations play in teaching digital composition. Introducing the digital into the composition classroom requires both challenging alphabetical and essayistic biases that may exist within English programs more generally, as well as establishing and maintaining technical relationships across faculty, libraries, and information specialists. Developing these relationships is as much an emotional as academic journey, as digital technologies often inspire anxiety and fear among even the most competent instructors. A key lesson from their essay is that "innovation often happens at the margins," and that the work of developing such institutional supports requires a broad shift in what we consider to be the *sites* of learning as such. 

Hayles, N. Katherine. "Speech, Writing, Code: Three Worldviews." *My Mother Was a Computer: Digital Subjects and Literary Texts*, U of Chicago P, 2005, pp. 39–61.

- Hayles' chapter situates computer code within a history of linguistics, from de Saussure's ideas of signs and signifiers, through Derrida's deconstructive grammatologies, and up to the present moment of object-oriented and executable programming languages. Hayles’ text maps out those characteristics not necessarily unique to but certainly present in code more so than in other linguistic systems, and in doing so lays the groundwork for later critical investigations of digital media, both on the level of hardware (e.g. media archaeology, platform studies) and software (critical code studies, software studies). Her most useful intervention may be in calling for a reinvigoration of material specificity in doing textual analysis—a new way to recast a turn to "form." Such an orientation may help those interested in articulating the affordances and limitations of *code itself*, rather than simply multimedia content, as a tool of argumentation.

Jones, John. "Network\* Writing." *Kairos*, vol. 20, no. 1, fall 2015, <http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.1/topoi/jones/index.html>.  

- Jones' article develops the concept of "network\* writing," wherein the \* wildcard operator, commonly used in search engines to pull variations of a word, gestures to the broader ways that writing practices are not only bound up with and respondent to networks, but also *create* networks as such. His essay usefully situates the work of writing within the specific economic and technical practices of search engines, particularly Google's PageRank algorithm, and as such provides key insights into how teaching writing involves our students within regimes of networked communication, politics, and economics.

Srnicek, Nick. *Platform Capitalism*. Polity P, 2017.

- Srnicek's book, while not directly bearing on rhetoric and composition, invaluably offers a succinct portrait of our contemporary information economy. He develops this portrait by drawing together a Marxist critique of the disparate microeconomies—advertising platforms, cloud computing, industrial management platforms, and so forth—and articulates them as a unified terrain of a new economy based on the surveillance of users and transacting upon extracted information. Moreover, given that the pace of this sector changes rapidly, this book's relatively recent publication makes it a useful resource for up-to-the-minute reflections on digital platform economies.
