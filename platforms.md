title: 'Platforms'

While all platforms have affordances and limitations that shape what kinds of activities, arguments, and engagements are possible on their services, there is still considerable variations among them that are worth taxonomizing. Such a taxonomy helps us understand what different types of platforms' stakes are in the first year composition classroom, whether directly or indirectly. 

Below, I offer a tree chart of what I see as particularly useful distinctions between various platforms that might crop up in the first year composition classroom. 

	                    Is the platform
	                          /  \	
	                         /    \
	                        /      \
	                       /        \
	               for-profit?    non-profit?
	                  |                    |
	                  |                    |
	         Does it cost money?      Is it open source?  
	                 /  \	                  / \
	                /    \                   /   \
	               /      \                 /     \ 
	              /        \               /       \
	            Yes        No            Yes       No
                 |          |             |         |
                 |          |             |         |
                 |          |             |         |
             Squarespace   Facebook    Wordpress  (Generally only technical
             Microsoft     Google      Wikipedia   components)
              
This is a self-consciously economic taxonomy. I could have broken down platforms by how they engage different kinds of media, what audiences they target, or what genres of writing they encourage. I chose the *economic*, instead, to gesture to the primary regime by which major digital platforms operate: the logic of Silicon Valley, or the logic of capitalism. This taxonomy helps us understand why various composition platforms make the design and business decisions that they make. **Often, moments of breakdown or crisis reveal the organizational priorities of platforms.** For instance, in October 2017, many journalists working in Google Docs [found themselves locked out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/31/a-mysterious-message-is-locking-google-docs-users-out-of-their-files/) of their work by a mysterious "Terms of Service" error. While this was a purely technical accident on Google's part, it revealed to many the extent to which Google was actively searching and monitoring what people wrote on their free Docs service. Why do this? For the same reason that Facebook scans profiles: [advertisement](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z9x6bk7). Free, for-profit services like Facebook and Google dominate the technical sector. Unlike services Like Squarespace or Microsoft, which charge a one-time or regular fee for use, these platforms mine users' data to package and sell to advertisers. **Introducing these platforms into the first year composition classroom may have the advantage of allowing students to compose on platforms familiar to them, or that can reach new and broader audiences, but have the disadvantage of carrying with them new and insidious regimes of surveillance.**
